Authors: Jason Carter & Melinda Frandsen

This is a video game programmed in the C# language. It is similar to the retro video game Space Invaders in gameplay,
but was modified with images from Star Wars for a fun spaceship video game experience. There are three levels, which 
increase in difficulty and speed. The player is an X-Wing Fighter pilot from the rebellioncan navigate on the screen 
from left to right. The object is to shoot all enemy spaceships within the incoming armada.
